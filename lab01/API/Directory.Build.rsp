#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains command-line options that MSBuild will process as part of
# every build, unless the "/noautoresponse" switch is specified.
#
# MSBuild processes the options in this file first, before processing the
# options on the command line. As a result, options on the command line can
# override the options in this file. However, depending on the options being
# set, the overriding can also result in conflicts.
#
# NOTE: The "/noautoresponse" switch cannot be specified in this file, nor in
# any response file that is referenced by this file.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Short form of /nodeReuse:false parameter. If this option is not specified,
# MSBuild process(es) will remain running after the build completes.
# The process(es) remain for some time in anticipation of a potential subsequent build.
/nr:false

# Short form /maxcpucount:[n] parameter. When /m switch is used without specifying a value,
# MSBuild will use up to the number of processors on the computer.
/m

# Pass the parameters that you specify to the console logger, which displays build information in the console window.
